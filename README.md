# **Note Taker**

## **Description**

This is a back-end project mainly involving express. We were given a starter code and needed to make the back-end work in order for the project to have any functionality. This was a fun project and a useful one that I will probably use myself in the future. This is the first project with a perptual "server" and using Heroku for deployment. 

One of the requirements was to have a unique ID generate for each note. I utilized an npm package called "shortid" for this. The repo for that can be found here: [shortid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shortid)

There was also a "bonus" to make the delete functionality work. This is working in my project and the .js file is notated with how this works.
